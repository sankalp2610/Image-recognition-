### Use your own model

Place your trained `.h5` file saved by `model.save()` under models directory.

Check the [commented code](https://github.com/mtobeiyf/keras-flask-deploy-webapp/blob/master/app.py#L37) in app.py.

### Use other pre-trained model

See [Keras applications](https://keras.io/applications/) for more available models such as DenseNet, MobilNet, NASNet, etc.

Check [this section](https://github.com/mtobeiyf/keras-flask-deploy-webapp/blob/master/app.py#L26) in app.py.
